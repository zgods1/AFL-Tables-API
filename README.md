# AFL Tables API

AFL Tables API is a website that can used to make REST API calls to get data out of AFL tables in JSON



## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt

python3 app.py
```

## TODO
### Major
Create API end point for all match scores(https://afltables.com/afl/seas/season_idx.html)
This will require a fair bit of work and manipulation of the data so is a long term project at this stage

Have this hosted on a server so that it can be publically used.

#### Add
- Team Win Loss Records(https://afltables.com/afl/teams/allteams/overall_wl.html)
- Attendances (https://afltables.com/afl/crowds/summary.html)


More will be added over time. But this is what is currently in the pipeline for this project
